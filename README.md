This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to the unexpected behavior of the `unset()` function when used inside a `foreach` loop iterating over an array.  The issue occurs when `unset()` is used to remove an element from the array during the iteration.  The `foreach` loop doesn't always adjust the index correctly, leading to skipped elements.  The solution illustrates how to avoid this issue by iterating over the array in reverse or using other methods.
